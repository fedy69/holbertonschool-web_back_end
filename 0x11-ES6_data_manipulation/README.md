# Using Map, Filter, and Reduce on Arrays

Map, filter, and reduce are powerful methods that allow you to manipulate arrays in a concise and efficient manner. Here are some examples of how to use them:

Map
The map method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array

In this example, the map method applies the arrow function num => num * 2 to every element in the numbers array, resulting in a new array where each element is doubled.

# Filter
The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function
the filter method applies the arrow function num => num % 2 === 0 to every element in the numbers array, resulting in a new array with only the even numbers.
